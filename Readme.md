# Motivation

This project is just a console program for the begineer for learning the concept of basic c like loop, incermentation and if-else conditionals.

---

# Build Status

This is a console clock, which I created using simple code of c. The program uses the header files that are **'stdio.h'** for standard input/output and **'windows.h'** for using function like - **exit()** and **system()**. It takes current time from user and then increases the `sec` variable in `1000ms` and shows the output changing in every `1000ms`.
